cloud platforms, in addition to being certified as a Terraform Associate. I have an advanced understanding of PyTorch, Tensorflow, Docker, and a range of other critical machine learning tools. I'm proficient with Python, SQL, and a variety of other programming
languages. Additionally, I have hands-on experience in data analysis, visualization, and logging using Power BI, Tableau, Weights &
Biases, ELK, and ML Flow.
